# PDF Append

---

A really easy to use Python script that effectively appends a PDF page, like a copyright disclaimer or something to that effect, at the end of another PDF.

Either clone the repo or download all the files (including the folders) to your computer.

Dependencies include Python 3.x and the PyPDF2 library.

Thanks to Mike Driscoll's post at https://realpython.com/pdf-python/.

All I did was wrap a iterater around it.
